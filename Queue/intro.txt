This is a simple linked-list implementation of a queue. It has 3 functions - the constrictor, enqueue, and dequeue. The enqueue and dequeue functions take O(1) time. If the dequeue operation is invalid, we return -1.  If the enqueue is invalid, we simply tell the user that is not allowed. I have included a Makefile - use make to complile this function, and edit the main.cpp file to change any tests.
